      <description>Clojure is a great language and has a great community surrounding it. It is opinionated, and if you want to get down to business and write code that solves problems, it mostly just gets out of your way.
It also lets me write lisp at work instead of Java!
Clojure has also allowed me to become less intimidated with lisp in general, and when I started working on a personal hobby project I decided to pick up another lisp language.</description>
